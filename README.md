DeFi offers new opportunities in finance and investing that were not available to many before in the traditional finance setting. However, DeFi is novel and often complex. Although DeFi is permissionless, the barriers to entry are often technical sophistication and/or financial literacy.

This document aims to be a guide to the resources and tools that can support users to utilise the possibilities in the DeFi ecosystem. From knowing the different between APR and APY, to the formulas behind exotic sythetic products, from checking if a protocol's smart contracts has been audited, to writing an automated trading system. A more financially literate, technologically sophisticated userbase is beneficial for development and wider adoption.

DeFi protocols are sometimes reffered to as 'Money Legos' as they are the 'building blocks' of the decentralised financial system that is being built on blockchain technologies. This document is the cement to these Money Legos.
